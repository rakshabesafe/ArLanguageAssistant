# Vuzix Z100 Language Assistant - Updated Fix Verification Checklist

This checklist focuses on verifying recent fixes, particularly the Gemini AI library update (`0.9.0`), the corrected `generateContent` method call, and the behavior of the new placeholder transliteration logic.

## 1. Gemini AI Library Update & `generateContent` Fix

*   [ ] **Test Case: AI Answer Feature Call**
    *   **Setup:**
        *   Ensure a valid Gemini API key is configured in `MainActivity.java`.
        *   Internet connection is active.
        *   Vuzix Z100 glasses connected and SDK control gained.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Select any "From Language" (e.g., English for asking the question).
        *   Select any "Display Language" (e.g., English (Latin Script)).
        *   Click the "Answer" button.
        *   When prompted ("Listening..."), ask a simple question (e.g., "What is the current time?").
    *   **Expected Result:**
        *   The application successfully calls the Gemini API using the updated library (version 0.9.0) and the corrected `generateContent(Content)` method.
        *   An AI-generated answer is received from the API.
        *   This answer (after being processed by the placeholder `transliterateForDisplay`) is displayed as scrolling text on the Vuzix glasses.
        *   No build errors related to Gemini API calls were encountered during the build process.
        *   No runtime crashes or exceptions occur specifically related to the `geminiModel.generateContent(content)` call.
    *   **Verification:**
        *   Confirm that an AI-generated answer is displayed on the Vuzix glasses. The content/accuracy of the answer is secondary for this specific test; the primary goal is to verify the successful API call and display.
        *   Check Logcat for any errors related to the Gemini API call (e.g., `NoSuchMethodError`, authentication issues if API key is wrong, network errors). Absence of errors related to the `generateContent` method signature is critical.

## 2. Transliteration Implementation (`transliterateForDisplay`)

*   [ ] **Test Case 1: Translation with Transliteration (Kannada to Latin Example)**
    *   **Setup:**
        *   Vuzix Z100 glasses connected and SDK control gained.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Select "From Language": **Kannada**
        *   Select "To Language": **Kannada** (this isolates the transliteration effect, as no actual translation occurs).
        *   Select "Display Language": **English (Latin Script)** (this option corresponds to the "en" code that triggers the placeholder's Kannada-to-Latin mapping).
        *   Click "Run."
        *   Speak a simple Kannada phrase containing characters mapped in the placeholder (e.g., "ಅ ಕ ಬ" - which includes 'ಅ', 'ಕ', 'ಬ').
    *   **Expected Result:**
        *   The spoken Kannada phrase is recognized.
        *   The `translateText` method passes the original Kannada text to `transliterateForDisplay` (as source and target languages are the same).
        *   The `transliterateForDisplay` method processes this Kannada text using its basic character map.
        *   The Vuzix glasses display a rudimentary Latin script version based on the placeholder's mapping (e.g., for "ಅ ಕ ಬ", it might appear as "a ka ba???" or similar, depending on how spaces and unmapped vowel diacritics are handled by the placeholder which currently maps them to '?').
    *   **Verification:**
        *   Observe the text displayed on the Vuzix glasses.
        *   Confirm that characters explicitly mapped in `transliterateForDisplay` (e.g., 'ಅ' to "a", 'ಕ' to "ka", 'ಬ' to "ba") appear as their Latin equivalents.
        *   Note how unmapped Kannada characters (e.g., complex conjuncts, less common vowel signs) and combinations are handled (e.g., displayed as "?").

*   [ ] **Test Case 2: AI Answer with Transliteration (English AI Answer to a different script - Flow Test)**
    *   **Setup:**
        *   Valid Gemini API key configured; Internet active.
        *   Vuzix Z100 glasses connected and SDK control gained.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Select "From Language": English (for asking the question).
        *   Select "Display Language": **Kannada (Kannada Script)** (this corresponds to the "kn" code).
        *   Click "Answer."
        *   Ask a question in English (e.g., "What are the primary colors?").
    *   **Expected Result:**
        *   The AI's answer (which will be in English) is fetched.
        *   This English answer is passed to `transliterateForDisplay` with "kn" (or the selected non-"en" code) as `targetScriptLanguageCode`.
        *   Since the current placeholder logic for `transliterateForDisplay` only implements basic Kannada-to-Latin mapping when `targetScriptLanguageCode` is "en", and returns the original text for other target scripts, the English text of the AI answer should be returned as-is.
        *   The original English AI answer is displayed on the Vuzix glasses.
    *   **Verification:**
        *   Observe the text on the Vuzix glasses. Confirm that the AI-generated answer (in English) is displayed. This test primarily verifies the data flow through the `transliterateForDisplay` method and its pass-through behavior for non-"en" target scripts.

## 3. `translateText` Call Verification (End-to-End Translation Flow)

*   [ ] **Test Case: Standard Translation Flow (e.g., English to Kannada, Display in Kannada Script)**
    *   **Setup:**
        *   Internet connection active (for ML Kit model download if needed).
        *   Vuzix Z100 glasses connected and SDK control gained.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Select "From Language": **English**
        *   Select "To Language": **Kannada**
        *   Select "Display Language": **Kannada (Kannada Script)** (target code "kn").
        *   Click "Run."
        *   Speak a common English phrase (e.g., "Hello world, how are you?").
    *   **Expected Result:**
        *   The English phrase is recognized.
        *   ML Kit translates the phrase to Kannada.
        *   The translated Kannada text is passed to `transliterateForDisplay`. Since the "Display Language" is set to "Kannada (Kannada Script)" (target code "kn"), the placeholder transliterator should return the Kannada text as-is (no conversion to Latin).
        *   The translated text in Kannada script is displayed on the Vuzix glasses.
    *   **Verification:**
        *   Confirm that the translated text appears on the Vuzix glasses in the expected target language and its native script (Kannada script in this example). This demonstrates that the `translateText` method is being called correctly and its output is successfully piped through the placeholder transliteration step (which correctly does nothing in this case) to the display.

## 4. General Stability

*   [ ] **Test Case: Repeated Mixed Operations**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Perform several translations using different language combinations.
        *   Perform several AI answer requests.
        *   Use the "Stop" button frequently, both during listening and while text is displayed.
        *   Rapidly switch between "Run" and "Answer" modes if possible (though one must complete before the other).
        *   Change language selections and scrolling speed between operations.
    *   **Expected Result:**
        *   The app remains stable and responsive throughout these operations.
        *   No crashes (application force closes) occur.
        *   No ANRs (Application Not Responding dialogues) are triggered.
    *   **Verification:**
        *   Monitor the application for any signs of instability, crashes, or unresponsiveness during and after the repeated operations.
        *   Check Logcat for any unexpected exceptions, error patterns, or excessive resource warnings.

This updated checklist provides more specific details for verifying the recent fixes related to the Gemini library and the transliteration placeholder.
