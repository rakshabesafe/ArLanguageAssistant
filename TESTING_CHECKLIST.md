# Vuzix Z100 Language Assistant - Testing Checklist

## 1. Prerequisites & Setup

*   [ ] Vuzix Z100 glasses are charged and paired with the Android phone via Vuzix Connect.
*   [ ] Android phone is running Android 12 (API Level 31) or later.
*   [ ] Language Assistant application is successfully installed on the Android phone.
*   [ ] Internet connection (Wi-Fi or Mobile Data) is active on the Android phone.
*   [ ] **Gemini API Key Configuration:**
    *   [ ] Verify that a valid Gemini API key has been inserted into the `GEMINI_API_KEY` constant in `MainActivity.java`.
    *   [ ] (If testing failure) Verify app behavior if the API key is missing or invalid (e.g., "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE").
*   [ ] **Permissions:**
    *   [ ] On first run of a feature requiring audio (Run/Answer), the app requests `RECORD_AUDIO` permission.
    *   [ ] Grant `RECORD_AUDIO` permission. Verify the feature proceeds.
    *   [ ] (Optional) Deny `RECORD_AUDIO` permission and verify the app handles this gracefully (e.g., feature doesn't work, informs user).

## 2. SDK Connection & Control

*   [ ] **Initial Connection:**
    *   [ ] Launch the app.
    *   [ ] Observe Toast message: "Vuzix Glasses Connected" (or similar positive confirmation).
    *   [ ] Verify that "Run" and "Answer" buttons are initially disabled, then become enabled after SDK control is gained.
*   [ ] **Disconnection/Reconnection:**
    *   [ ] **Bluetooth Cycle:**
        *   [ ] While app is running and connected, turn off Bluetooth on the phone.
        *   [ ] Observe Toast message: "Vuzix Glasses Disconnected."
        *   [ ] Verify "Run" and "Answer" buttons become disabled.
        *   [ ] Turn Bluetooth back on.
        *   [ ] Observe Toast message: "Vuzix Glasses Connected."
        *   [ ] Verify "Run" and "Answer" buttons become enabled.
    *   [ ] **Vuzix Connect App Cycle (if possible):**
        *   [ ] Disconnect glasses from Vuzix Connect app.
        *   [ ] Observe behavior in Language Assistant (similar to Bluetooth cycle).
        *   [ ] Reconnect glasses in Vuzix Connect app.
        *   [ ] Observe behavior in Language Assistant.
*   [ ] **No Glasses/Vuzix Connect:**
    *   [ ] Launch app with Vuzix Z100 glasses turned off or Vuzix Connect app not running/connected.
    *   [ ] Verify app shows an appropriate state (e.g., "Vuzix Glasses Disconnected" Toast, buttons remain disabled).
    *   [ ] Verify app does not crash.

## 3. Translation Feature

*   **Language Selection:**
    *   [ ] Verify "From Language" spinner is populated with: English, Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Spanish, French, German.
    *   [ ] Verify "To Language" spinner is populated with the same list.
    *   [ ] Verify "Display Language" spinner is populated with: English (Latin Script), Kannada (Kannada Script), Telugu (Telugu Script), Hindi (Devanagari Script).
    *   [ ] Select "English" as "From," "Kannada" as "To," and "English (Latin Script)" as "Display."
    *   [ ] Select "Hindi" as "From," "English" as "To," and "English (Latin Script)" as "Display."
    *   [ ] Select "Kannada" as "From," "Telugu" as "To," and "Kannada (Kannada Script)" as "Display."
*   **Voice Input & Translation:**
    *   [ ] **Scenario 1 (English to Kannada, Display English Script):**
        *   [ ] Set: From=English, To=Kannada, Display=English (Latin Script).
        *   [ ] Click "Run." Observe "Listening..." Toast.
        *   [ ] Speak "Hello, how are you?".
        *   [ ] Observe recognized text Toast.
        *   [ ] Verify translated text (Kannada meaning, in Latin script due to placeholder transliteration) appears on Vuzix glasses.
        *   [ ] Test with a longer phrase like "What is the weather like today?".
    *   [ ] **Scenario 2 (Hindi to English, Display English Script):**
        *   [ ] Set: From=Hindi, To=English, Display=English (Latin Script).
        *   [ ] Click "Run."
        *   [ ] Speak a phrase in Hindi (e.g., "आपका नाम क्या है?").
        *   [ ] Verify translated text (English meaning) appears on glasses.
    *   [ ] **Scenario 3 (Same Languages):**
        *   [ ] Set: From=English, To=English, Display=English (Latin Script).
        *   [ ] Click "Run." Speak "Testing same language."
        *   [ ] Verify the original text "Testing same language" appears on glasses (no actual translation).
    *   [ ] **Accuracy:**
        *   [ ] For a few common phrases, qualitatively assess if the translation meaning is correct (note: dependent on ML Kit quality).
        *   [ ] Verify transliteration placeholder: the script of the displayed text should match the *translated language's native script* if "Display Language" for that script is chosen, OR it should be in Latin script if "English (Latin Script)" is chosen (as transliteration is a placeholder, it will just show the translated output as-is).
*   **Scrolling:**
    *   [ ] Verify text scrolls automatically on the glasses display.
    *   [ ] **Speed Adjustment:**
        *   [ ] Enter "0.5" in "Scrolling Speed." Perform a translation. Observe scroll speed.
        *   [ ] Enter "1.0" in "Scrolling Speed." Perform a translation. Observe scroll speed is likely faster than 0.5.
        *   [ ] Enter "2.0" in "Scrolling Speed." Perform a translation. Observe scroll speed is likely faster than 1.0.
        *   [ ] Enter an invalid value (e.g., "abc" or "0" or "-1"). Perform a translation. Verify speed defaults to 1.0 (or a sensible default) and a Toast indicates invalid input.
*   **"Stop" Button:**
    *   [ ] While app is listening (after clicking "Run"), click "Stop."
        *   [ ] Verify listening stops (e.g., "Listening..." Toast disappears if it's persistent, or no further speech is processed).
        *   [ ] Verify Run/Answer buttons become re-enabled (if SDK is still controlled).
    *   [ ] While text is scrolling on glasses after a translation, click "Stop."
        *   [ ] Verify text is cleared from the Vuzix glasses display.
*   **Error Handling (Translation):**
    *   [ ] Click "Run," but remain silent.
        *   [ ] Verify a "No match" or "Speech timeout" error is shown via Toast.
        *   [ ] Verify app returns to idle state (Run/Answer buttons enabled).
    *   [ ] (If possible to simulate) Turn off internet.
        *   [ ] Try translating a language pair for which models haven't been downloaded. Observe behavior (e.g., "Model Download Error" Toast).
        *   [ ] If speech recognizer relies on network, observe behavior when trying to speak with internet off.

## 4. AI Answer Feature

*   **Voice Input & AI Response:**
    *   [ ] **Scenario 1 (English Question, Display English Script):**
        *   [ ] Set: From=English (for speech input), Display=English (Latin Script).
        *   [ ] Click "Answer." Observe "Listening..." Toast.
        *   [ ] Ask a question like "What is the capital of France?".
        *   [ ] Observe recognized question Toast.
        *   [ ] Verify a relevant answer (e.g., "Paris") appears on the Vuzix glasses. (Text should be in English).
    *   [ ] **Scenario 2 (Hindi Question, Display Hindi Script - check placeholder behavior):**
        *   [ ] Set: From=Hindi, Display=Hindi (Devanagari Script).
        *   [ ] Click "Answer."
        *   [ ] Ask a question in Hindi.
        *   [ ] Verify an answer appears on glasses. (AI answers are in English; placeholder transliteration means it will be English text displayed).
    *   [ ] **Accuracy/Relevance:**
        *   [ ] Ask various general knowledge questions. Qualitatively assess if AI answers are relevant and make sense (note: dependent on Gemini quality).
        *   [ ] Verify transliteration placeholder for AI answers: English answers should appear as English text regardless of "Display Language" due to placeholder.
*   **Scrolling (AI Answers):**
    *   [ ] Verify AI answer text scrolls automatically on the glasses display.
    *   [ ] Test scrolling speed adjustment as per "Translation Feature -> Scrolling -> Speed Adjustment."
*   **"Stop" Button (AI Answers):**
    *   [ ] While app is listening (after clicking "Answer"), click "Stop."
        *   [ ] Verify listening stops.
        *   [ ] Verify Run/Answer buttons re-enabled.
    *   [ ] While an AI answer is scrolling on glasses, click "Stop."
        *   [ ] Verify text is cleared from the Vuzix glasses display.
*   **Error Handling (AI Answers):**
    *   [ ] Click "Answer," but remain silent.
        *   [ ] Verify a "No match" or "Speech timeout" error Toast.
        *   [ ] Verify app returns to idle state.
    *   [ ] Turn off internet connection.
        *   [ ] Click "Answer" and ask a question.
        *   [ ] Verify an error related to network/API call failure is shown (e.g., "AI Error: ...").
    *   [ ] **API Key (if testable):**
        *   [ ] If using the placeholder `GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"`.
        *   [ ] Click "Answer" and ask a question.
        *   [ ] Verify a Toast message like "Gemini API Key is not configured." or "AI Model not initialized." is shown.
        *   [ ] Verify no attempt is made to contact the API.

## 5. General UI & Usability

*   [ ] **Responsiveness:**
    *   [ ] App responds to button clicks without noticeable delay.
    *   [ ] Switching between languages in spinners is smooth.
*   [ ] **Clarity:**
    *   [ ] All buttons (Run, Stop, Answer) and spinners are clearly labeled.
    *   [ ] Toast messages for app status (Listening, Connected, Errors) are easy to understand.
*   [ ] **Stability:**
    *   [ ] Perform various sequences of operations (translate, answer, stop, change languages, disconnect/reconnect) repeatedly.
    *   [ ] Verify no crashes (application force closes) occur.
    *   [ ] Verify no ANRs (Application Not Responding) occur.
*   [ ] **Orientation Changes (Phone UI):**
    *   [ ] (If phone UI supports rotation) Rotate the phone while the app is running.
    *   [ ] Verify the app handles orientation change without crashing or losing state (e.g., selected languages, text in EditText). Typically, glasses companion apps are fixed to portrait, so this might be N/A.
*   [ ] **Logging:**
    *   [ ] (For developers/testers with Logcat access) Verify that key events, errors, and data processing steps are logged appropriately in Logcat, as described in previous implementation summaries (e.g., SDK status, recognized text, translated text, AI prompt/response, errors).

This checklist provides a structured approach to testing the Vuzix Z100 Language Assistant. Remember to note down any unexpected behavior, errors, or areas for improvement.Okay, I have created the `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` file with the comprehensive testing checklist for the Vuzix Z100 Language Assistant application, formatted in Markdown.

The checklist covers:
1.  **Prerequisites & Setup:** Ensuring the environment and app are ready.
2.  **SDK Connection & Control:** Testing the link between the app and the Vuzix glasses.
3.  **Translation Feature:** Detailed checks for language selection, voice input, translation quality (high-level), transliteration (placeholder behavior), scrolling, stop functionality, and error handling.
4.  **AI Answer Feature:** Detailed checks for voice input, AI response quality (high-level), transliteration (placeholder behavior), scrolling, stop functionality, and error handling, including API key and internet issues.
5.  **General UI & Usability:** Covering responsiveness, clarity, stability, orientation changes (if applicable), and logging.

This checklist should be detailed enough for a user to perform thorough testing of the application's current features.
